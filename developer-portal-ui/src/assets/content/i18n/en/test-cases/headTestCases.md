# Explanation of the Test cases

After loading test data into the system, TPP developer can test ModelBank endpoints with Swagger or Postman tests. In Swagger section you can find information about usage of Swagger, prepared test data (JSONs) for testing and short API documentation.

In Postman tests section you can find information about usage of Postman for testing and download prepared Postman tests with testing data.

Both sections provide tests for REDIRECT Strong Customer Authorisation (SCA) approach and EMBEDDED SCA Approach for Payment Initiation Service (PIS), Account Information Service (AIS) and Payment Instrument Issuer Service (PIIS).

Modelbank functionality supports all mandatory services of XS2A.
Optional services are supported via UI partially and can be completely tested only through XS2A interface.
